Subject: [PATCH] kubeadm: reduce UpgradeManifestTimeout

This modifies kubeadm UpgradeManifestTimeout from 5 minutes default
to 3 minutes to reduce the unnecessary delay in retries during
kubeadm-upgrade-apply failures.

The typical control-plane upgrade of static pods is 75 to 85 seconds,
so 3 minutes gives adequate buffer to complete the operation.
