  =======================================================================
  .
  Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
  does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
  Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
  other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
  information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
  warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
  terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
  disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the
  fullest extent possible.
  .
  Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
  .
  Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
  conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
  original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
  and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
  following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
  exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
  .
       Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
       intended for use by those authorized to give the public
       permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
       copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
       irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
       and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
       Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
       applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
       material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
       material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
       licensed material, or material used under an exception or
       limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
  	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
  .
       Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
       licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
       licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
       the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
       example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
       copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
       licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
       other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
       the licensed material may still be restricted for other
       reasons, including because others have copyright or other
       rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
       such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
       Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
       respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
       for the public:

  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public
  License
  .
  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
  to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
  Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public
  License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
  contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
  acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
  such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
  making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
  conditions.
  .
  .
  Section 1 -- Definitions.
  .
    a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
       Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
       and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
       arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
       permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
       Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
       Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
       Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
       synched in timed relation with a moving image.
  .
    b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
       and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
       accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
  .
    c. BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at
       creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative
       Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.
  .
    d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
       closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
       performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
       Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
       categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
       specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
       Rights.
  .
    e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
       absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
       fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
       Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
       agreements.
  .
    f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
       any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
       that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

       of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this
       Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.
  .
    h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
       or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
       License.
  .
    i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
       terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
       all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
       Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
  .
    j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
       under this Public License.
  .
    k. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
       process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
       as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
       dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
       available to the public including in ways that members of the
       public may access the material from a place and at a time
       individually chosen by them.
  .
    l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
       resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
       the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
       as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
       equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
  .
    m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
       under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
  .
  .
  Section 2 -- Scope.
  .
    a. License grant.
  .
         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
            the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
            non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
            exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
  .
              a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                 in part; and
  .
              b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
  .
         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
            Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
            License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
            its terms and conditions.
  .
         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
            6(a).
  .
         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
            Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
            all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
            and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
            Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
            authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
            necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
            technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
            Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
            simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
            (4) never produces Adapted Material.
  .
         5. Downstream recipients.
  .
              a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                 recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                 receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                 Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                 Public License.
  .
              b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                 Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                 automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                 exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                 under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
  .
              c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                 any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                 apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                 Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                 Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                 Material.
  .
         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
            may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
            are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
            with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
            the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
            provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
  .
    b. Other rights.
  .
         1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
            licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
            privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
            the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
            assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
            extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
            Rights, but not otherwise.
  .
         2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
            Public License.
  .
         3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
            under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
            licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
            reserves any right to collect such royalties.
  .
  .
  Section 3 -- License Conditions.
  .
  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
  following conditions.
  .
    a. Attribution.
  .
         1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
            form), You must:
  .
              a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                 with the Licensed Material:
  .
                   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                      Material and any others designated to receive
                      attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                      the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                      designated);
  .
                  ii. a copyright notice;
  .
                 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
  .
                  iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                      warranties;
  .
                   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                      extent reasonably practicable;
  .
              b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                 retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
  .
              c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                 Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                 hyperlink to, this Public License.
  .
         2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
            reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
            hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
            information.
  .
         3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
            information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
            reasonably practicable.
  .
    b. ShareAlike.

         3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
            or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological

            rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.

  .
    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database

  .
       including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share

       IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  .
    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
       above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent

    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and

  Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
  .
  Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
  conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
  original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
  and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
  following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
  exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
  .
       Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
       intended for use by those authorized to give the public
       permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
       copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
       irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
       and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
       Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
       applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
       material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
       material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
       licensed material, or material used under an exception or
       limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
  	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
  .
       Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
       licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
       licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
       the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
       example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
       copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
       licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
       other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
       the licensed material may still be restricted for other
       reasons, including because others have copyright or other
       rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
       such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
       Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
       respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License
  .
  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
  to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
  Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
  extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
  granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
  these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
  consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
  Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
  .
  .
  Section 1 -- Definitions.
  .
    a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
       Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
       and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
       arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
       permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
       Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
       Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
       Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
       synched in timed relation with a moving image.
  .
    b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
       and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
       accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
  .
    c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
       closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
       performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
       Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
       categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
       specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
       Rights.
  .
    d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
       absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
       fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
       Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
       agreements.
  .
    e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
       any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
       that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
  .
    f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
       or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
       License.
  .
    g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
       terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
       all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
       Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
  .
    h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
       under this Public License.
  .
    i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
       process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
       as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
       dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
       available to the public including in ways that members of the
       public may access the material from a place and at a time
       individually chosen by them.
  .
    j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
       resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
       the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
       as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
       equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
  .
    k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
       under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
  .
  .
  Section 2 -- Scope.
  .
    a. License grant.
  .
         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
            the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
            non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
            exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
  .
              a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                 in part; and
  .
              b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
  .
         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
            Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
            License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
            its terms and conditions.
  .
         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
            6(a).
  .
         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
            Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
            all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
            and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
            Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
            authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
            necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
            technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
            Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
            simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
            (4) never produces Adapted Material.
  .
         5. Downstream recipients.
  .
              a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                 recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                 receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                 Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                 Public License.
  .
              b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                 any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                 apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                 Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                 Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                 Material.
  .
         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
            may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
            are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
            with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
            the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
            provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
  .
    b. Other rights.
  .
         1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
            licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
            privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
            the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
            assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
            extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
            Rights, but not otherwise.
  .
         2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
            Public License.
  .
         3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
            under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
            licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
            reserves any right to collect such royalties.
  .
  .
  Section 3 -- License Conditions.
  .
  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
  following conditions.
  .
    a. Attribution.
  .
         1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
            form), You must:
  .
              a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                 with the Licensed Material:
  .
                   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                      Material and any others designated to receive
                      attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                      the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                      designated);
  .
                  ii. a copyright notice;
  .
                 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
  .
                  iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                      warranties;
  .
                   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                      extent reasonably practicable;
  .
              b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                 retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
  .
              c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                 Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                 hyperlink to, this Public License.
  .
         2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
            reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
            hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
            information.
  .
         3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
            information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
            reasonably practicable.
  .
         4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
            License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
            Material from complying with this Public License.
  .
  .
  Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
  .
  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
  apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
  .
    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
       to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
       portion of the contents of the database;
  .
    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
       contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
       Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
       Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
  .
    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
       all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
  .
  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
  replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
  Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
  .
  .
  Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
  .
    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
       EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
       AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
       ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
       IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
       WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
       ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
       KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
       ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  .

       INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
       COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
       USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
       ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
       DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
       IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  .
    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
       above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
       possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
       waiver of all liability.
  .
  .
  Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
  .
    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
       Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
       this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License

    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
       Section 6(a), it reinstates:
  .
         1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided

            violation; or
  .
         2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
  .
       For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
       right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
       of this Public License.
  .
    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
       Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
       distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
       will not terminate this Public License.
  .
    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
       License.
  .
