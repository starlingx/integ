Subject: [PATCH] Fix exceptions import issue

The puppet-module horizon 17.4.0-4 version has an error in the
debian packaging. The "fix-local-settings-for-debian.patch"
(included in the package) removes wrongly the
openstack_dashboard.exceptions import. This module overrides the
openstack-dashboard local_settings.py module during the unlocking
process and horizon service fails to get enabled.
