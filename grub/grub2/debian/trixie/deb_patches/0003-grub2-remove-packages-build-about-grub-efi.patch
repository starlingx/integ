-Description: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (loong64 UEFI modules)
- GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
- cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
- .
-  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
-  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
-  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
-    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
-    update-grub.
- .
- This package contains GRUB modules that have been built for use on loong64
- systems with UEFI.  It can be installed in parallel with other flavours,
- but will not automatically install GRUB as the active boot loader nor
- automatically update grub.cfg on upgrade unless grub-efi-loong64 is also
- installed.
