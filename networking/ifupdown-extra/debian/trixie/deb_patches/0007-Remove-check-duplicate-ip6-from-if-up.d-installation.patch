Subject: [PATCH] Remove check-duplicate-ip6 from if-up.d installation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Duplicate address checks for IPv6 are already handled externally by the
system through kernel-managed mechanisms. Since these validations are
already in place, installing an additional if-up script becomes
redundant. Removing this script avoids duplicated checks and keeps the
behavior aligned with the kernel’s native IPv6 address validation.
