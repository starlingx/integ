Subject: Wait for devices to be configured after boot

It was observed that dhcp requests happen too soon after boot.
It may happen that the NIC driver won't rename the interface
because it is in use.
Time is needed for drivers to rename NICs before using them.

Use 'udevadm settle' to let the devices be configured before
continuing the configuration process.
