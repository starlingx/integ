Description:
  The stalld program (which stands for 'stall daemon') is a
  mechanism to prevent the starvation of operating system threads in a
  Linux system. The premise is to start up on a housekeeping cpu (one
  that is not used for real-application purposes) and to periodically
  monitor the state of each thread in the system, looking for a thread
  that has been on a run queue (i.e. ready to run) for a specifed length
  of time without being run. This condition is usually hit when the
  thread is on the same cpu as a high-priority cpu-intensive task and
  therefore is being given no opportunity to run.
